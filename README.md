# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
We used six different supervised machine learning models in order to determine if a candidate's loan would be considered and high or low risk based from credit card data.
## Results
1. Naive Random Oversampling
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.6403; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.01 and recall is 0.66. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.62. 

2. SMOTE Oversampling
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.6515; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.01 and recall is 0.61. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.69. 

3. Undersamplings via Cluster Centroids
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.5443; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.01 and recall is 0.69. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.40. 

4. SMOTEEN Sampling
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.6429; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.01 and recall is 0.71. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.57. 

5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.7885; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.03 and recall is 0.70. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.87. 

6. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
- The balanced accuracy score is 0.9317; when looking at the high risk loans the precision is 0.01 and recall is 0.71. For low risk loans the precision is at 1.00 and recall 0.57.
